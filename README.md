# dotmot-i
Dot motion detection/discrimination task built in psychopy

Most of the pupilcore class uses freely available code from pupil-lab's API

Containts unit conversions to check eye deviation from central fixation in degrees of visual angle. Also computes the eye-tracker's measurement error--which pilot testing revealed to be quite substantial > 1.5 deg. The eye-tracker should work fine for real-world tracking, but not screen-based tracking requiring sustained central fixation.
